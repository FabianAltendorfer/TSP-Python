The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is a classic example of a combinatorial optimization problem within the field of 
computer science and operations research. It poses a simple yet complex question: given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of them, what is 
the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city? Despite its straightforward presentation, the TSP is notoriously 
difficult to solve as the number of potential routes increases factorially with the number of cities, making it infeasible to solve by brute force for all but 
the smallest instances. The TSP is known to be NP-hard, which implies that there is no known algorithm capable of solving all instances of the problem in 
polynomial time. Its significance extends beyond theoretical interest; it models numerous real-world problems, from logistics and transportation to the arrangement 
of manufacturing processes, making its study both practical and essential for finding efficient solutions to complex routing problems.


Possible Solutions: Optimal, Approximation and Heuristic.
- Approximation means we have a quality guarantee but we probably won't get to the optimal solution.
- With a Heuristic we get a reasonable good solution in a reasonable amount of time.

In this repo I use a Construction Heuristic. In particular a greedy construction heuristic.
